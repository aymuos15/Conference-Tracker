I have attached a json file. 

It contains conferences and their submission deadline.

My problem is that there is no way to automatically get:
-  the latest deadline and
-  the current conference site for this year (or latest one which has taken place.)

Can you do it for me please?

I want the json code updated.

Thank you very much! :)
